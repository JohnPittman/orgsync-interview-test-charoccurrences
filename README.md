Using only core libraries, create a function which takes a string and outputs the character
that appears the most along with its total count and the character that appears the least
with its total count. In the event of a tie print the character with the lowest code point.
Please provide your solution in a language of your choice and list any assumptions you
make about the problem.  
  
#Assumptions  

- Raw JavaScript.  
- Multiple characters can tie as the highest amount. Codepoint will then be the determining factor.  
- Multiple characters can tie as the lowest amount. Codepoint will then be the determining factor.  
- There could be no lowest amount as stated in the description. Codepoint will then be the determining factor.
